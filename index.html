    <h1>🦊 Meet Drip</h1>
    <div class="story">
        <p>🏝️ I used to play on a Minecraft server with my classmates. I had a base made of floating islands — a large one in the center, with smaller, less important ones surrounding it.</p>
        <p>💧 The only way to reach them was a single stream of water that ran all the way down to the ground.<br>
            🚶‍♂️ As you can imagine, it was hard to bring mobs up there, and I felt kind of lonely.<br>
            🦊 I decided to bring up a companion — I found a fox holding an emerald and jokingly named him Drip.<br>
            📤 I brought him up the water stream and started building a dedicated island just for him.</p>

        <p>Sadly, the bridges connecting the islands weren’t very safe, and Drip fell off to his death.</p>

        <p>🌼 The island I had built for him became a graveyard, with only his tombstone on it.<br>
            💎 I placed his emerald on the grave, along with a book where everyone wrote a message to Drip.<br>
            🌟 Drip had been the mascot of the server for its entire life — losing him was a big moment.</p>

        <p>👤 To honor him, I took on his name, so he would never be forgotten.<br>
            💬 I changed my Discord name to Drip, and it has stayed that way ever since.</p>

        <p>🌈 Drip lives on, enjoying paradise.</p>

        <p>Drip loves you and wants to be remembered.<br>
        Send Drip a message of love, keep his soul alive.</p>
